/*
Given an array of integers citations where citations[i] is the number of citations a researcher received for their ith paper, return compute the researcher's h-index.

According to the definition of h-index on Wikipedia: A scientist has an index h if h of their n papers have at least h citations each, and the other n âˆ’ h papers have no more than h citations each.

If there are several possible values for h, the maximum one is taken as the h-index.*/
